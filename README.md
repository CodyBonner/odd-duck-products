### Reflections and Comments

Learning Journal 3:

Paper View
This past week has been beneficial to me on a learning experience because not only did I get to continue putting in time learning the fundamentals of the languages I will be using for software development. I also learned the importance in my own practice to fully utilize IDs when it comes to  the relationship between HTML and CSS.

I also learned that while I may have a good deal of knowledge when it comes to computer languages that are used in software development. There's still plenty I haven't learned but that go hand in hand with many ideas I have when it comes to website develop and just how much goes into simple things like displaying an image on alert based on a user response. It's not as simple as I thought which isn't a bad thing. It gives me something exciting to look forward to.

I look forward to learning more and developing my skills further.
