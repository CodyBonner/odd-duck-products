### Reflections and Comments

Learning Journal 3:

Paper View
The past couple weeks have been challenging but they have also been rewarding. I learned and struggled with object literals and constructors in the beginning but once I understood how to use them it became much easier. I still have a lot to learn about their capabilities. However I am enjoying utilizing the construction of HTML elements from inside of javascript so that way HTML does not stay super cluttered.

I look forward to learning more and developing my skills further.
